#  Hand Gesture-Controlled Presentation System 🖐️  

An **AI-powered** system that enables users to control presentations using **hand gestures** instead of a mouse or keyboard. This project utilizes **Computer Vision** and **Python** to provide a seamless, interactive, and user-friendly way to navigate slides.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Swipe gestures** to navigate slides 🚀  
✅ **Point & highlight** key content ✍️  
✅ **Draw & annotate directly on slides** 🎨  
✅ **Undo mistakes with a simple gesture** 🔄  
✅ **No extra hardware required – works with a standard webcam!** 🎥  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, OS  
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Hardware:** Webcam (720p or above)  

---

## 📷 How It Works  
1. **Camera Captures Gestures** 📸 – The webcam detects hand movements in real time.  
2. **AI Model Recognizes Gestures** 🤖 – Computer Vision techniques identify gestures.  
3. **Mapping to Presentation Actions** 🖥️ – The system translates recognized gestures into commands.  
4. **Users Interact with Presentations Naturally** ✋ – No need for a mouse, keyboard, or remote!
